Mortality-Opioid 
Predictive Analysis of Mortality Rate on Opioid Consumption


My project is about Accidental death by fatal drug overdose in 2014 over the 50 states in USA.
This project is to search for possible solutions to reduce this mortality rate by looking at some of the factors that lead to person being prescribed opioids which sometimes might lead to death if abused or with an accidental overdose.
I am presenting this project to the Board of Health so it helps them to make more strict laws for doctors prescribing more opioids for a condition that could be treated with a non-opioid prescription.
This cleaned data set contains 25000 observations from all 50 states
